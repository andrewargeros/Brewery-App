# Minnesota Craft Brewery App

Minnesota is home to a ridiculous number of craft breweries-- more than 250 to give an idea. Many of these are members of the Minnesota Craft Brewer's Guild, a group who create an annual "passport" of BOGO coupons at many of these establishments across the state, known as [Craft Notes](https://craftnotes.net/shop/minnesota-craft-beer-passport-cnmncbg-combo-pack/). This passport was gifted to me as a birthday present, and my girlfriend and I have been treating these passport stamps as a means of data collection.

This app contains the location of every brewery in the state (to my knowledge), and aggregates our ratings, comments, and rankings together to show the course of our beer journey!
